[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samvv/node-find-free-ports.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samvv/node-find-free-ports)

This is a very small package that allows developers to find free ports
on the local system. Unlike most other "find-free-port" utilities, this library
allows scanning for multiple free ports at once, making sure that there are no
doubles in the result.

‚úîÔ∏è TypeScript support 

‚úîÔ∏è No dependencies

‚úîÔ∏è Should work on all major NodeJS versions

‚úîÔ∏è Now automatically tested for mistakes

This library has been benchmarked and parallelises the port checks using a
customisable number of workers for optimal performance. The alogithm does
**not** create a new anonymous socket for each port, but instead iterates in
parallell over the system's port numbers. This is both faster and less
resource-intensive.

```
npm i find-free-ports
```

## Usage

Import the library:

```js
import findFreePorts from "find-free-ports"
```
or
```js
const findFreePorts = require('find-free-ports');
```

Next, call the main function with the amount of free ports you need:

```js
async function startMultipleServers() {
  const [a, b, c, d] = await findFreePorts(4);
  // now do something interesting with the new ports ...
}
```
